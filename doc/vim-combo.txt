Each keystroke in insert mode increases your combo, but not typing for 1 second resets it.
Hacks are not patched around : you can keep a key pressed to increase your combo, and CTRL+SHIFT+V will all be counted as a combo.

Best score is displayed next to the current combo in square brackets. When a new high score is achieved, it is saved inside .vim as .combo.
If you get errors at launch, check that .combo exists and has just a number inside (should be 0, or last best combo).

The plugin is still under construction. Right now, you will need to edit the path to the .combo file and choose where to display the combo information.
By default, the section B of airline-vim is overwritten to display current combo. A random Runic character has been chosen to indicate the combo field.
